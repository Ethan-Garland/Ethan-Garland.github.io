// step 1: define our variables with the let keyword
// step 2: define a new variable for the evaluation of the formula
// step 3: set our new variable = the value we are trying to find
// step 4: Print our result to the console.

// find the average of two numbers
let number1 = 6;
let number2 = 4;
let average = (number1 + number2)/2;
console.log("the average if the two numbers is " + average + ".");

//find the area of a circle pi*r**2
let radius = 5;
let area = Math.PI*radius**2;
console.log("The area of a circle is " + area + ".");

//displacement is  Î”y=.5at**2 (change in y equals .5 * acceleration * time squared)

let acceleration = 10;
let time = 5;
let changeY = .5*acceleration*time**2;
console.log("The Change in Y is " + changeY + ".");

// solutions to 0 = ax**2 + bx + c are x = (-b +- sqrt(b**2 - 4ac))
